Known Problems:
  Had bugs with function on how to implement the restocking of drink menu items on the Manager.html page, as well as how to display how much of each drink is left, and were unable to finish the implementation of this.
  Account info on the VIP page has a bug, and even with completely recoding the code, it still won't work. Unsure why the modal won't show up, but VIP users are unable to see their credit amount and add to their account.
