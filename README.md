How to run:
Run the index file to get to our login page. From here, you can choose to proceed as either a guest, or log in as a VIP,
Manager or Bartender. The manager log in has the username: sammow password: sam123, the VIP has the log in
username: paibur password: paige123. Once you log in you can go ahead and navigate and use the program. 

Known problems:
Can't update storage as bartender, which itself doesnt update some parts in the manager page.
